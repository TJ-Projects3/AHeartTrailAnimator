This is a foundational Heart Trail Animator web application I made in June 2024. 
This project initiates animations as your mouse moves anywhere on the webpage. It uses HTML, CSS, and JS with Vercel deployment.

To view this project, download the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey.
After downloading, you should see the "Go Live" button at the bottom of the webpage
